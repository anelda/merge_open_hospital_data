## Background: `afrimapr` and `afrihealthsites`

Early in March 2020 the [_afrimapr_ team](http://afrimapr.org) started looking into [mapping, comparing, 
and combining open health facility data](https://afrimapr.github.io/afrimapr.website/blog/2020/healthsites-app/)
sets to enable better access for decision makers in Africa during 
and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The [`afrihealthsites` package](http://afrimapr.org/code) currently allows 
one to compare two existing continental open data sets - one developed by the Kenya Medical Research Institute 
(KEMRI) in collaboration with the WHO, the second a global crowd sourced open health facilities mapping project 
- [healthsites.io](https://healthsites.io). `afrihealthsites` is under active development and we aim to get it
out to potential users very early in the development cycle to allow for continuous input that can shape its functionality.

## Building reusable code to facilitate mapping, comparing, and combining of open health facility data

The ultimate aim of this project is to work through the process of collating the best possible facility list for open data 
sets available for South Africa by combining various openly available resources. 
We acknowledge that this cannot be called the Master
Facility List as we will only work with openly available data sets and do not have access to all information available
to the Department of Health (beyond what is published in the Data Dictionary). As all countries have to work through this process 
sooner or later (and quite often more than once), we want to understand the process and 
see where [_afrimapr_](http://afrimapr.org) can aid by developing building blocks to facilitate similar processes and
complimentary data analysis workflows.
